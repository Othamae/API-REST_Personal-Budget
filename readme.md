# Personal Budget

## Project Overview

For this project, I build an API that allows clients to create and manage a personal budget. Using Envelope Budgeting principles, the API should allow users to manage budget envelopes and track the balance of each envelope. The API should follow best practices regarding REST endpoint naming conventions, proper response codes, etc. and include data validation to ensure users do not overspend their budget!

### Project Objectives:
- Build an API using Node.js and Express
- Be able to create, read, update, and delete envelopes
- Create endpoint(s) to update envelope balances
- Use Git version control to keep track of your work
- Use the command line to navigate your files and folders
- Use Postman to test API endpoints

#### Postgres DB
I have used Postgres database.
